introduction: |
  Lead Engineer at [Klarna](https://klarna.com). I’m really passionate about engineering best practices. I think the biggest problem for developers is lack of focus. 
  As a developer who specialises in *JavaScript*, I’m helping to find solutions through applying functional programming principles. I organise meetups, record coding videos, and speak about my findings.
